Todo / Ideas
============

- Only send date/time in bbox request not full meta
  - If data/process time changes reinit/reload layer/meta
    so that if style etc has changed we will switch
- Possibility to send feature limit to backend
- Show if feature limit has been reached
- Zoom limit from layer config e.g. if on to high zoom level dont issue bbox
  but delete layer - Show a statement to zoom in
- Load signalling somewhere 
- File serve url route
- Display long description of layer processing (iframe popover with
  file from database?)
- Possibility to address style by a database column
- Slide in on left with a list of layers
- Fix remote control link deleting position "#" anchor
- Add possibility of an RSS feed based on the current view
  -> Database column with feature bbox and RSS info
- Feature selection for edit link 
  -> multiple ways, relations, nodes
- Backend call to hide features (processed)
  -> Needs "empty" database column for hidden features
  -> Could we simply change the style and popup?
- Dont send full meta information in every request
